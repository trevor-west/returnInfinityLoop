# returnInfinityLoop
A simple javacript program to loop until it returns infinity.

Warning: Don't run this in your browser or in node as it will likely crash your computer (as it did for me).

I will edit this in the future to make the loop x variable increase exponentially so it reduces the chance of crashing your comp.
